# Solution Assessment #

## Stage 1: Initialization and Setup

- [x] Great
- [ ] Perfect
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

#### Justification 
The initialization and setup logic is generally well-handled. The `target`, `dist_above_target`, and other variables are well-defined and logically grouped. `dist_above_target` is used to set an initial camera height relative to the target. 

To improve this, I recommend adding a check to confirm `target` is assigned before accessing `target.position` in `_process`. If `target` is null, this could lead to runtime errors.

___

## Stage 2: Camera Controls

- [ ] Perfect
- [x] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

#### Justification
The camera zoom controls are implemented well, with the `zoom_in` and `zoom_out` functions properly clamping `dist_above_target` between `min_zoom` and `max_zoom` values. The toggle for `draw_camera_logic` is also clear and functional.

However, consider enhancing user experience by adding smooth zoom transitions, which could be done using interpolation (e.g., `lerp`). This would make zoom adjustments feel more gradual and less abrupt.

___

## Stage 3: Optional Camera Tilt

- [ ] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [x] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

#### Justification
The commented-out tilt functionality is a solid foundation, and the logic for gradual re-centering of `_camera_tilt_rad` is an excellent touch. However, the code could benefit from implementing a maximum tilt angle to prevent the camera from rotating too far left or right. You could achieve this by clamping `_camera_tilt_rad` within a defined range.

___

## Stage 4: Camera Following Logic

- [ ] Perfect
- [x] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

#### Justification
The camera's position is set to follow the target based on its Y position, which is effective for a basic follow system. One enhancement could be to add a smooth follow effect (e.g., using `lerp`), which would create a lag effect for a more natural camera movement.

___

## Stage 5: Placeholder Draw Logic

- [ ] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [ ] Good
- [x] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

#### Justification
The `draw_logic` function is currently a placeholder. It's clear this could be expanded with debugging or visualization logic if necessary. This could add value by visualizing the camera's position and target alignment, particularly for debugging purposes.

___

# Code Style #

### Description 
The code generally follows GDScript conventions, with clear variable names and logical grouping of functions. However, a few minor style improvements could be made.

#### Style Guide Infractions ####

- *Unnecessary comments* - There are several commented-out lines related to `camera_tilt` which can be removed or replaced with active functionality. Consider keeping comments that explain complex logic, rather than entire blocks of unused code.

#### Style Guide Exemplars ####

- *Consistent variable naming* - Variables such as `dist_above_target` and `zoom_speed` are self-explanatory and follow GDScript's naming conventions.

___

# Best Practices #

### Description 

The code is close to following best practices, though a few modifications could enhance maintainability and readability.

#### Best Practices Infractions ####

- **Null check for target:** Before accessing `target.position`, add a check to ensure `target` is not null. This will prevent potential runtime errors.
- **Smooth transitions:** Implementing `lerp` for smoother camera transitions would be a useful enhancement, especially for zoom and follow functions.

#### Best Practices Exemplars ####

- **Effective use of clamping:** The `clampf` function for zooming in and out is a good use of clamping to maintain values within the defined range.
